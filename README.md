## Ansible Prototpying Code

Prototyping / experimental code for _limited use_ of ansible-vault from within JVM applications.

This repository is for experimentation with the original ansible vault code and seeing how it can be made more generic, etc.

Eventually this code will migrate into kiwi ( https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwi )

**Update 2020-08-05: This code has been migrated into [kiwi](https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwi)**
